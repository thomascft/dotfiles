## About

These dotfiles are intended to be used by NixOS and home-manager.
You'll probably want to look in `home/` to find each program's configuration.
I've been daily driving NixOS for about two months at the time of writing,
 so expect there to be major changes as I continue to expand my knowledge of Nix and the surrounding ecosystem.
