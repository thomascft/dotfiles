Presenting...

My Dotfiles!, They're not too got and a bit buggy, but I'm proud of them. I've been dily driving linux for about 3 months. Soo... let's get back on point.
    The wonderful tools that help me accomplish all I do are:
        -Bspwm
        -Polybar
        -Dunst
        -Zsh
        -Picom
        -rofi
        -the unixporn community
I'm knda new to this, but have fun with them. 
    To install them clone these into your home directory and use `Stow` to well stow the folders you want.
