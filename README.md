**Presenting...**

My Dotfiles!, They're not too got and a bit buggy, but I'm proud of them. I've been dily driving linux for about 3 months. Soo... let's get back on point.
    The wonderful tools that help me accomplish all I do are:
    <ul>
        <li>Bspwm
        <li>Polybar
        <li>Dunst
        <li>Zsh
        <li>Picom
        <li>rofi
    <ul>
I'm kinda new to this, but have fun with them.

To install them clone these into your home directory and use `Stow` to link the folders you want.
